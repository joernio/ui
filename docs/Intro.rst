Intro
-----
**CPG UI Client** is a GUI for command-line code analysis tools like Ocular and Joern.
It provides a GUI skin, wrapping many of these code analysis tool's features and making it possible for analysts to perform code analysis in a code-editor-like environment.

Analysts can:

* manipulate workspaces and projects under them. 

* Run CPG queries in a command line-like terminal or a more user-friendly query execution component.

* Create, delete, view, and edit scala scripts used to automate code analysis operations.

* View repository folder structures and inspect repository files without having to open the repository on a separate code editor.

* View query latency in real time.

And many other minute but interesting interactions to make your job as a security analyst easier.
